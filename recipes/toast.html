      <p>Toast is one of the most delicious and comforting breakfast foods out there. 
        Imagine a crispy, golden-brown slice of bread, perfectly toasted to your liking, 
        with a warm and fluffy interior just waiting to be slathered with tons of beans.</p>
      <p>The history of bread goes back thousands of years, with evidence of bread-making dating 
        back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt and Mesopotamia. Bread was originally made 
        using simple ingredients like flour, water, and yeast or sourdough starter. 
        As bread-making techniques evolved, different types of bread emerged, from crusty 
        artisan loaves to soft and fluffy sandwich bread.</p>

      <p>But it wasn't until the invention of the toaster in the early 20th century that toast 
        became the perfect vessel for beans all around the world. The first electric toaster was 
        invented by a Scottish scientist named Alan MacMasters in 1893, but it wasn't until the 
        1920s that toasters became popular household appliances.</p>

      <p>Today, toast can be made with any type of bread, from white to whole wheat to sourdough, 
        and can be topped with a wide variety of beans, from Black and Pinto to Great Northern 
        and Kidney. Whether you prefer your toast lightly toasted or deeply roasted, 
        there's nothing quite like the warm and comforting taste of toast to 
        start your day off right.</p>
